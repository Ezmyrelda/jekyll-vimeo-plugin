#Jekyll Vimeo Plugin
This plugin makes it easy to embed videos from Vimeo by using a simple Liquid tag that looks like this:

    {% vimeo 12345678 %}

It's based of the [Youtube plugin/gist](http://www.portwaypoint.co.uk/jekyll-youtube-liquid-template-tag-gist/ "Jekyll Youtube Liquid Template Tag Gist") from Portway Point.
